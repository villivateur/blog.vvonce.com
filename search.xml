In result, embedded Youtube will treat you as no logged in guest.</p><p>Chrome or Edge may have some familiar issues, but I did not test them.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It annoys me when I upgraded Adobe Acrobat Reader a few days ago. The “All tools” panel keeps showing when I open a new PDF.</p><p>I tried some solutions that tell me to open <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Documents</code> and check <code>Remember current state of Tools pane</code>, but it does not work on the newest version of Acrobat Reader.</p><h2 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h2><p>Adobe has admit that the <em>feature</em> cannot be removed. So, the only solution is to go back to an older version. You can just download a previous version of Acrobat Reader, or try:</p><p>Click “Go to old UI” in “File”.</p><p>Then apply the step above.</p>]]></content>
